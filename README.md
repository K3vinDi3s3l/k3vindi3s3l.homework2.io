I created a website with my bio
I used only html and bootstrap.
the website consists of a home page with my image ( no image uploaded ) alonf with a small description about myself.
Next there is the Portfolio page which is where my future pojects will be listed. Right now you wll only be able to see placeholders.
Lastly there's the contact page where anyone interested wil be able to emal me by entering their name , email and text in the content box.
Al three pages have two navbars. One on the top with the links to the pages mentioned above and one on the bottom with lnks to me email and github account.
The pages contain contaiers, rows and columns and the lay out is responsive. 
When the page is minimized the contet stacks up on top of eachother for easier view o a smartphone while the navbar turns into drops down when you click on it.
